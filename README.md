# modules
My eurorack modules! Designed so **ANYBODY** can build them! BOMS, Panel Designs, Schematics, PCBs, and more!
Inspired by Mutable Instruments design and naming


# Guidelines for cloning
If you make a clone, these are not required, but we'd deeply appreciate if you do these:
1. Do not use the formation electronics name in clones
2. Try to distance your clones from the original module
